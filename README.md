Technical challenge as per ViewLift's interview process. 
A simple Android app for a playlist of video data gathered from an XML resource: 
http://sample-firetv-web-app.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/feed_firetv.xml

External libraries used were ExoPlayer for video playback capabilities, and UniversalImageLoader for 
dynamically loading thumbnail previews of videos onto selectable ListView items.
